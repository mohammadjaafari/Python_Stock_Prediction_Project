## Aim of the project

The Project was done as a teamwork collaborative project for my Artificial Intelligence course at LAU.

THe project was done with my teammate Abdel Rahman Al Kadi

THe aim of this project was to demonstrate data analysis, visualization, and machine learning usage (K-Means Clustering) on real life stocks.

## Software and Libraries used

Jupyter Notebook is used to run Python's libraries to do all the data analysis, visualization and machine learning.

## The Data

The data is extracted from https://api.tdameritrade.com/ 

## How to run

### The jupyter notebook file will be uploaded soon

To run the project, download the jupyter notebook, open the notebook using jupyter and run all cells. (Python, jupyter notebook and the respective Python libraries must be installed prior to running the project)

However, in the repository an html file that showcases the results of the project is already attached and it mimics the act of doing all the steps above by opening it. The only downside is that the html file is static and not susceptible to code changes.
